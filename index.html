        <p>AWK is one of the most prominent text-processing utilities on GNU/Linux. It is very powerful and uses simple programming language. It can solve complex text processing tasks with a few lines of code. Starting with an overview of AWK, its environment, and workflow, the tutorial proceeds to explain the syntax, variables, operators, arrays, loops, and functions used in AWK. It also covers topics such as output redirection and pretty printing.</p>
        <p>This tutorial will be useful for software developers, system administrators, or any enthusiastic reader inclined to learn how to do text processing and data extraction in Unix-like environment. You must have a basic understanding of GNU/Linux operating system and shell scripting.</p>
